Hot to setup new repository on github with vs code

1. Create local folder with your files
For now, I usualy have javascript, html, css and one README.md in my folder.

2. LogIn github site, press + on the upper right side of the screen and chose "new repository"

3. Pick name, description and don't pick the option to create README. Press "Create repository"

4. On the next screen, the important part is the link to your repository, in this case:
https://github.com/Nei-V/instructions-vs-code-github.git

5. return to VS Code. Chose "View" in the menu and pick "integrated terminal"

6. you will be given a command line, you have to be in the folder you created, if not, move to it typing "cd.." to move one folder up and "cd folderName" (replace folderName with your folder's name)to enter it.
